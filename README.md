## Overview

[NAME] is a world full-stack enterprise application that mimics the core functionalities of Twitter, but is restricted to use by groups of friends. This application has a secure authentication system and focuses on performance, scalability, and a user-friendly design.

## Project Aim & Objectives

### Aim

To develop a secure, scalable platform that provides a private social network for friends to communicate and share updates.

### Objectives

- **Secure Authentication:** Utilise robust security measures (JWT, encryption, etc.) for user authentication.
- **Real-Time Interaction:** Implement real-time updates for posts, and comments.
- **Group Management:** Enable users to create and manage friend groups for targeted communication.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Provide comprehensive error handling and logging for reliability.
- **Core Functionality Testing:** The core features such as authentication are tested.

## System Architecture

The application is built using a three-layer architecture:

- **Frontend:** A responsive web interface that provides the user experience.
- **Backend:** A RESTful API handling business logic and data processing.
- **Database:** A robust database solution that stores user data, posts, and group information.

## Enterprise Considerations

- **Performance:** Optimised data models are implemented to significantly reduce latency and improve load times. By minimising redundant database queries, the application delivers a responsive user experience, even under high demand. This is important for keeping interactions smooth and efficient.
- **Scalability:** Vercel automatically scales both the frontend and backend to manage varying traffic. However, this is limited by the selected plan; for example, the free plan offers fewer resources compared to the pro plan. This means that while the system can handle some traffic dynamically, future upgrades would be required to support very high usage and growth.
- **Robustness:** Comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms ensure that the system remains stable and is recoverable from unexpected failures. Logs help diagnose issues in real-time, allowing for easier maintenance. This resilience is key to a reliable service even when encountering edge cases.
- **Security:** Adopting industry best practices, the application utilises secure authentication methods, data encryption, and input validation. These measures are designed to protect sensitive data from common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, creating a secure environment for all users while maintaining trust and integrity.
- **Additional Considerations:**

## Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration ensures that only authorised users can access the application. This protects personal data and maintains privacy within the friend group.
- **User Profiles & Group Management:** Customise profiles and manage friend groups for private interactions. This feature enables users to control their online identity and create personalised circles, ensuring that content is shared selectively and remains within trusted communities.
- **Post Creation & Timeline:** Users can create, edit, and delete posts and view a real-time feed from friends. This core functionality allows for communication between friends, allowing users to express themselves and stay updated with the latest updatesd in a private, controlled network.
- **Interactions:** Like, comment, and share posts to boost engagement. These interactive elements are designed to improve social aspects, promote active participation, and create an engaging experience.

## Deployment

- **Database:** The application uses a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase. This setup provides a robust, scalable, and fully managed SQL database, with reliable data storage and efficient query processing for the application's data needs.
- **Backend:** The backend is deployed as serverless functions on Vercel. This approach removes the need for traditional servers, offering on-demand scaling, reduced maintenance, and cost efficiency while allowing fast and secure API responses.
- **Frontend:** The frontend is also deployed on Vercel. Vercelâ€™s optimized hosting environment means the application benefits from fast load times and seamless integration with the backend, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Environment Variables:** Sensitive configuration details such as the database URL and authentication secrets are stored securely using environment variables. These are managed within Vercel to ensure security, prevent unauthorized access.

## Installation & Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- A PostgreSQL database
